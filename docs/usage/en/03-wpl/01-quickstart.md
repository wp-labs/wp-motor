Get started with WPL in 5 minutes and start parsing your log data immediately.

## What is WPL?

WPL (Warp Processing Language) is a **declarative rule language** for describing how to **extract fields** and **parse structures** from text data such as logs and messages.

### Core Features

- **Declarative**: Describe "what data is" rather than "how to extract"
- **Type-Safe**: Automatic validation and conversion (IP, time, JSON, and 37 types)
- **Powerful & Flexible**: Support for JSON/KV nested extraction, Base64 decoding, field validation
- **Easy to Learn**: Get started with basics in 5 minutes

### Use Cases

- Parse web server logs (Nginx, Apache)
- Extract JSON/KV structured data
- Process encoded data (Base64, Hex)
- Parse firewall and security device logs
- Custom log format parsing
