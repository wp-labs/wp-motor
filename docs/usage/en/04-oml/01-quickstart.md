Get started with OML in 5 minutes and transform your parsed data.

## What is OML?

OML (Object Model Language) is a **declarative transformation language** that converts parsed data from WPL into the desired output format.

### Core Features

- **Declarative**: Describe "what you want" rather than "how to implement"
- **Type System**: 8 data types with automatic inference and conversion
- **Powerful Functions**: Built-in functions, pipeline functions, pattern matching
- **Flexible Operations**: Field extraction, data aggregation, conditional processing
- **SQL Integration**: Enrich data with database queries

### How OML Works with WPL

```
WPL (Parse) → Structured Data → OML (Transform) → Output
```
